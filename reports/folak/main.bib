  abstract     = {Only a few large studies of interobserver reproducibility of Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma exist. Thirty-eight biopsies containing prostate cancer were distributed for Gleason grading to 41 general pathologists in Georgia. These cases had "consensus" Gleason grade groups (2-4, 5-6, 7, and 8-10) that were agreed on by at least 7 of 10 urologic pathologists. The overall kappa (kappa) coefficient for interobserver agreement for these 38 cases was 0.435, barely moderate agreement, with a kappa range from 0.00 to 0.88. There was consistent undergrading of Gleason scores 5-6 (47\%), 7 (47\%) and, to a lesser extent, 8-10 (25\%). In cases with consensus primary patterns, there was consistent undergrading of patterns 2 (32\%), 3 (39\%), and 5 (30\%). Pattern 2 was often (17\%) mistaken for pattern 3. Pattern 4 was often undergraded (21\%) and also mistaken for pattern 5 (17\%). The most significant (P {\textless} .005) demographic factor associated with better interobserver agreement was having learned Gleason grading at a meeting or course. We believe that Gleason grading can be learned to a satisfactory level of interobserver reproducibility and have undertaken additional studies that support this belief.},

Forty-six needle biopsies containing prostatic carcinoma were assigned Gleason scores by 10 urologic pathologists. The overall weighted kappa coefficient kappa(w) for Gleason score for each of the urologic pathologists compared with each of the remaining urologic pathologists ranged from 0.56 to 0.70, all but one being at least 0.60 (substantial agreement). The overall kappa coefficient kappa for each pathologist compared with the others for Gleason score groups 2-4, 5-6, 7, and 8-10 ranged from 0.47 to 0.64 (moderate-substantial agreement), only one less than 0.50. At least 70\% of the urologic pathologists agreed on the Gleason grade group (2-4, 5-6, 7, 8-10) in 38 ("consensus" cases) of the 46 cases. The 8 "nonconsensus" cases included low-grade tumors, tumors with small cribriform proliferations, and tumors whose histology was on the border between Gleason patterns.

  abstract     = {The Gleason score is the most important prognostic marker for prostate cancer patients, but it suffers from significant observer variability. Artificial intelligence ({AI}) systems based on deep learning can achieve pathologist-level performance at Gleason grading. However, the performance of such systems can degrade in the presence of artifacts, foreign tissue, or other anomalies. Pathologists integrating their expertise with feedback from an {AI} system could result in a synergy that outperforms both the individual pathologist and the system. Despite the hype around {AI} assistance, existing literature on this topic within the pathology domain is limited. We investigated the value of {AI} assistance for grading prostate biopsies. A panel of 14 observers graded 160 biopsies with and without {AI} assistance. Using {AI}, the agreement of the panel with an expert reference standard increased significantly (quadratically weighted Cohen's kappa, 0.799 vs. 0.872; p = 0.019). On an external validation set of 87 cases, the panel showed a significant increase in agreement with a panel of international experts in prostate pathology (quadratically weighted Cohen's kappa, 0.733 vs. 0.786; p = 0.003). In both experiments, on a group-level, {AI}-assisted pathologists outperformed the unassisted pathologists and the standalone {AI} system. Our results show the potential of {AI} systems for Gleason grading, but more importantly, show the benefits of pathologist-{AI} synergy.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({ConvNets}) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up {MobileNets} and {ResNet}. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called {EfficientNets}, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous {ConvNets}. In particular, our {EfficientNet}-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3\% top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet}, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing {ConvNet}. Our {EfficientNets} also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on {CIFAR}-100 (91.7\%), Flowers (98.8\%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

We evaluated this framework at scale on a dataset of 44,732 whole slide images from 15,187 patients without any form of data curation. Tests on prostate cancer, basal cell carcinoma and breast cancer metastases to axillary lymph nodes resulted in areas under the curve above 0.98 for all cancer types. Its clinical application would allow pathologists to exclude 65-75\% of slides while retaining 100\% sensitivity. Our results show that this system has the ability to train accurate classification models at unprecedented scale, laying the foundation for the deployment of computational decision support systems in clinical practice.},

This paper describes a new method for setting the learning rate, named cyclical learning rates, which practically eliminates the need to experimentally find the best values and schedule for the global learning rates. Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. Training with cyclical learning rates instead of fixed values achieves improved classification accuracy without a need to tune and often in fewer iterations. This paper also describes a simple way to estimate "reasonable bounds" -- linearly increasing the learning rate of the network for a few epochs. In addition, cyclical learning rates are demonstrated on the {CIFAR}-10 and {CIFAR}-100 datasets with {ResNets}, Stochastic Depth networks, and {DenseNets}, and the {ImageNet} dataset with the {AlexNet} and {GoogLeNet} architectures. These are practical tools for everyone who trains neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have enabled progress in a wide variety of applications. Growing the size of the neural network typically results in improved accuracy. As model sizes grow, the memory and compute requirements for training these models also increases. We introduce a technique to train deep neural networks using half precision floating point numbers. In our technique, weights, activations and gradients are stored in {IEEE} half-precision format. Half-precision floating numbers have limited numerical range compared to single-precision numbers. We propose two techniques to handle this loss of information. Firstly, we recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of the weights that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step. This single-precision copy is rounded to half-precision format during training. Secondly, we propose scaling the loss appropriately to handle the loss of information with half-precision gradients. We demonstrate that this approach works for a wide variety of models including convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. This technique works for large scale models with more than 100 million parameters trained on large datasets. Using this approach, we can reduce the memory consumption of deep learning models by nearly 2x. In future processors, we can also expect a significant computation speedup using half-precision hardware units.},

For this purpose, we performed a registry-based analysis of machine-learning-related studies that were published and first available in the {ClinicalTrials}.gov database until 2020, using the database’s study classification. In total, n = 358 eligible studies could be included in the analysis. Of these, 82\% were initiated by academic institutions/university (hospitals) and 18\% by industry sponsors. A total of 96\% were national and 4\% international. About half of the studies (47\%) had at least one recruiting location in a country in North America, followed by Europe (37\%) and Asia (15\%). Most of the studies reported were initiated in the medical field of imaging (12\%), followed by cardiology, psychiatry, anesthesia/intensive care medicine (all 11\%) and neurology (10\%). Although the majority of the clinical studies were still initiated in an academic research context, the first industry-financed projects on machine-learning-based algorithms are becoming visible. The number of clinical studies with machine-learning-related applications and the variety of medical challenges addressed serve to indicate their increasing importance in future clinical care. Finally, they also set a time frame for the adjustment of medical device-related regulation and governance.},
